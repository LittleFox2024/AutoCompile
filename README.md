# AutoCompile
A GUI to compile code, for people who don't like the command line or just want something easier to use. It is simply a front end for common tools such as GCC, Clang, and Python (and yes, you *can* compile Python to an executable).

# How To Use
You will need:
* Python 3, or the executable (which I plan to release at some point
* The compiler you intend to use. You need either the path to it, or it needs to be in your $PATH variable.
* Something to compile!
Run execute.bat (Windows), AutoCompile.exe (Windows), execute.sh (Linux/Mac)
*These will be added as soon as I have something working...*
