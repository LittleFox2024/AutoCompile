# AutoCompile
A GUI to compile code, for people who don't like the command line or just want something easier to use. It is simply a front end for common tools such as GCC, Clang, and Python (and yes, you *can* compile Python to an executable).

# How To Use
You will need:
* Python 3
* The compiler you intend to use. You need either the path to it, or it needs to be in your $PATH variable.
* Something to compile!
Run `python main.py` to get started.
